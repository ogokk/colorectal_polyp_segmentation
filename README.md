# A new imbalance-aware loss function to be used in a deep neural network for colorectal polyp segmentation [[Paper]](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compbiomed.2022.106205)
A software tool that integrates a novel imbalance-aware loss function—Omni-Comprehensive Loss into an end-to-end CNN-based polyp segmentation framework in colorectal imaging. The proposed loss function jointly incorporates region-based, shape-aware, and pixel-wise evaluation components, effectively addressing key challenges such as class imbalance and vanishing gradients in medical image segmentation models.
